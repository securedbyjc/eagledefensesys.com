# GCP Audit Evidence Demo

> 🛡️ **Educational demonstration** of automated GCP security data transformation for compliance frameworks

**Purpose:** This educational project demonstrates how Google Cloud Platform security data can be automatically transformed into audit-ready evidence packages for compliance frameworks like NIST 800-53, CMMC, and FedRAMP.

**Contribution to GRC Community:** Bridges the gap between cloud-native security tooling (APIs, JSON) and traditional audit requirements (Excel, documentation).

---

## 🎯 The Problem This Solves

Modern cloud environments generate thousands of security findings, but compliance teams face three critical challenges:

1. **Format Mismatch**: Security tools output JSON/API data; auditors need Excel spreadsheets
2. **Framework Translation**: Raw findings must map to specific compliance controls (NIST AC-3, CMMC AC.L2-3.1.1, etc.)
3. **Evidence Packaging**: Audit artifacts must be bundled with proper documentation and timestamps

**This demo shows one approach to automation that addresses all three challenges.**

---

## 📊 What Gets Generated

The tool produces a complete audit evidence package:

- **Executive Summary**: Finding counts by severity, top issues
- **Detailed Findings**: Each security finding mapped to relevant framework controls  
- **Framework Mapping**: Cross-reference showing which controls are covered
- **Evidence Log**: Screenshot inventory with hyperlinks to supporting materials
- **Timestamped Bundle**: Complete package with evidence files included

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

```
Mock GCP Data → Framework Mapping → Excel Generation → Evidence Bundle
     ↓                   ↓                ↓               ↓
 findings.json    framework_map.csv   Formatted      Timestamped
 siem_events.json                     Spreadsheet     .zip Package
```

**Key Components:**

- **Data Ingestion**: Simulated GCP Security Command Center findings
- **Framework Engine**: Maps findings to compliance controls via CSV lookup
- **Excel Generator**: Creates formatted, audit-ready spreadsheets
- **Evidence Manager**: Bundles screenshots and supporting documentation

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

**Prerequisites:**

```bash
python 3.8+
pip install pandas openpyxl
```

**Run the Demo:**

```bash
git clone [repository-url]
cd gcp-audit-evidence-demo
pip install -r exporter/requirements.txt
python exporter/main.py
```

**Output:** Check the `output/` directory for timestamped audit packages.

## 🎨 Sample Framework Mapping

The demo includes educational examples of how security findings map to compliance controls:

| Rule ID | NIST Reference | CMMC Reference | Description |
|---------|---------------|----------------|-------------|
| DEMO_AC_001 | AC-3 | AC.L2-3.1.1 | Access Control Demo |
| DEMO_AU_001 | AU-2 | AU.L2-3.3.1 | Audit Events Demo |
| DEMO_SC_001 | SC-7 | SC.L2-3.13.1 | Boundary Protection Demo |

*Note: Production implementations require detailed framework analysis and control interpretation.*

## 🔧 Customization Points

**For Educational Use:**

- Modify `mock_data/` files to simulate different scenarios
- Update `framework_map.csv` with additional compliance frameworks
- Customize Excel formatting in the beautification functions

**For Production Use:**

- Replace mock data with actual GCP API integrations
- Implement proper authentication and cross-project data collection
- Add incremental update capabilities
- Extend framework mappings with professional control analysis

---

## 📈 Extending the Demo

**Potential Enhancements:**

1. **Real GCP Integration**: Connect to Security Command Center, Cloud Asset Inventory
2. **Additional Frameworks**: SOC 2, ISO 27001, PCI-DSS mappings
3. **Automated Scheduling**: Deploy as Cloud Function with scheduled execution
4. **Advanced Analytics**: Trend analysis, risk scoring, compliance dashboards
