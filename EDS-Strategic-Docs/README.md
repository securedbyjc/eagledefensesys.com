Welcome to the official documentation repository for Eagle Defense Systems (EDS).
This repository organizes and manages both internal cybersecurity lab projects and external client consulting deliverables.

🛡️ Purpose
Internal Labs:
Develop, test, and harden cybersecurity environments (Hyper-V labs, GRC automation, DevSecOps experiments).

Public Portfolio:
Showcase selected non-sensitive lab setups and technical walkthroughs for professional branding.

Client Consulting:
Manage standardized templates, policy libraries, and compliance report structures to support client work.
